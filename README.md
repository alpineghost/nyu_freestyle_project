# MTA Bus Status App

This app was developed as the freestyle project for the course Programming with Python taught by Professor Mike Rossetti at NYU.
The app allows the user to find out the location of every bus on a chosen bus line by providing the next bus stop and how close each bus is to the next bus stop.

## Getting Started

This app requires the user to have access to an API key from the MTA. The user can request an API key at http://bustime.mta.info/wiki/Developers/Index and the app will ask for an API key before pulling the information about buses.

### Prerequisites

This app was designed for Python 3.x and requires some python packages.
The app uses:
json
urllib
pandas
