### Objective

The MTA Bus App was designed to allow the user to get real-time information about the location of MTA buses.

### Inputs

The user will need to enter an API Key to allow the app to access the feed on the MTA webpage.

The user will then input the selected bus line. Please note that the app is case-sensitive and bus lines should be entered
exactly as they are displayed by the MTA.

### Outputs

Before providing the outputs, the app welcomes the user and asks for the API key and the selected bus line.

After those inputs have been entered, the app provides the location of each bus for the selected bus line.
The location is provided with the next stop for each bus and how close the bus it to approaching it.
